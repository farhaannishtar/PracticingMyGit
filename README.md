# PracticingMyGit (commit 1)

I am learning very slowly, but very surely (commit 1 for practice-branch)

I can do this. With enough effort and patience, I will get good at this (commit 2 for practice-branch)

I'm gonna make it (commit 3 for practice-branch)

I'm running out of motivational things to say for my commits (commit 4 for practice-branch)

Thanks Alisha for helping me with git (commit 5 for practice-branch)
