# PracticingMyGit 

I believe in myself that I will be a successful and 
competent programmer :^) I am visualizing myself getting 
things done and solving problems. Each task I complete is like me 
slaying a monster in RuneScape with my mage skills. I 
will be paid for my computer wizardry and will make this my trade in life.
